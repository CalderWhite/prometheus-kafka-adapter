# prometheus-kafka-adapter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter)

prometheus-kafka-adapter is a service which receives [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus) requests through [`remote_write`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write), marshal into JSON and sends them into [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka).


## motivation

We use `prometheus-kafka-adapter` internally at Telefonica for dumping Prometheus metrics into an object store in diferent clouds, through [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) and Kafka-Connect.


## output

It produces the following messages in a kafka topic:

```json
{
  "__timestamp__": 1234567890,
  "__value__": 9876543210,
  
  "__name__": "up",
  "job": "federation",

  "label1": "value1",
  "label2": "value2"
}
```

`__timestamp__` and `__value__` are reserved values, and can't be used as label names. `__name__` defines the name of the metric.


## configuration

It can be configured with the following environment variables:

- `LOG_LEVEL`: defines log level for [`logrus`](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus), can be `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal` or `panic`, defaults to `info`.
- `KAFKA_BROKER_LIST`: defines kafka endpoint and port, defaults to `kafka:9092`.
- `KAFKA_TOPIC`: defines kafka topic to be used, defaults to `metrics`.
- `PORT`: defines http port to listen, defaults to `8080`, used directly by [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).
- `GIN_MODE`: manage [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) debug logging, can be `debug` or `release`.
