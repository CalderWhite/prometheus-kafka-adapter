# prometheus-kafka-adapter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter)

prometheus-kafka-adapter is a service which receives [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus) requests through [`remote_write`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write), marshal into JSON and sends them into [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka).

## configuration

It can be configured with the following environment variables:

- `LOG_LEVEL`: defines log level for [`logrus`](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus), can be `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal` or `panic`, defaults to `info`.
- `KAFKA_BROKER_LIST`: defines kafka endpoint and port, defaults to `kafka:9092`.
- `KAFKA_TOPIC`: defines kafka topic to be used, defaults to `metrics`.
- `PORT`: defines http port to listen, defaults to `8080`, used directly by [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).
